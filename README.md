# Road Accident Analysis
## Overview
This project conducts a comprehensive data analytics study focused on road accidents. The primary emphasis is on analyzing total casualties in both the current and previous years. The analysis extends to categorizing various types of accidents, identifying the vehicles involved, and scrutinizing the geographical areas or locations where these accidents occur.

## Data Collection
The data used in this project has been collected from various sources that provide information on road accidents. This includes government databases, open data platforms, and other relevant datasets.

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning involved:

* Removing duplicates
* Handling missing values
* Standardizing data formats
* Correcting inconsistencies

## Analysis
The analysis is divided into several key areas:
1.  **Total Casualties Analysis**:
*   Comparison of total casualties between the current and previous years.
2.  **Accident Type Categorization**:
*   Categorizing various types of accidents (e.g., collisions, rollovers).
3.  **Vehicle Involvement**:
*   Identifying the types of vehicles involved in accidents (e.g., cars, trucks, motorcycles).
4.  **Geographical Analysis**:
*   Analyzing the geographical areas or locations where accidents occur.
*   Identifying accident hotspots.

## Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations to support the analysis, such as:

*   Bar charts
*   Line graphs
*   Heat maps
*   Scatter plots

These visualizations help in understanding the data and drawing meaningful insights.

## Conclusions
